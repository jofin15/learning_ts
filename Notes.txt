a programming language that was created to address the shortcoming of js
it was build on top of js. Every js file is a valid typescript file 
typescript is js with typechecking

Ts benefits 
1. Static typing
-> type which are not changed during runtime 
->language such as c++,java 
-> for example 
int number=10
number="a"     //this is not allowed

Dynamic typing 
->type which can be changed durinng runtime 
->language such as python, javascript 
->for example
int number=10
number="jofin"    //this may be allowedd

2. code completion
3.refactoring
4. shorthand notations

drawbacks
1. compilation (we always need  to transpile  the typescript , because browser cannot understand)
transpilation:- converting ts into js
2.it is used to build in production level project (medium to large) .To save money and time
